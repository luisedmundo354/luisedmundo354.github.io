summary:
  - "I am a Research Assistant in Dr. Van Durme's lab at Johns Hopkins University, where I work on NLP, argument mining, and legal reasoning. I earned my M.S. in Engineering Management from Johns Hopkins in 2025, under the guidance of Dr. Mahyar Fazlyab. Before this, I led teams in hospitality, retail, software, and sports."
  - "My research focuses on interpretable, safe, and reliable language models for legal analysis. I use declarative language models, case grammar, and LLMs to produce evidence-grounded outputs with calibrated uncertainty. I aim to support legal reasoning by surfacing relevant facts, constructing and critiquing arguments, and aiding high-stakes decisions. My current work examines how models can make evidence evaluation more transparent and capture the different ways humans weigh legal factors."
