## About Me {#about}

I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Engineering Management at Johns Hopkins University, where I am supervised by Professor Mahyar Fazlyab. In addition to my studies, I am working on an independent project called [Mentat](https://www.mentat.health/), serving as an event manager at the Peabody Institute, and conducting research on information extraction.

My research focuses on reinforcement learning, natural language processing, and process automation. I aim to integrate digital and physical systems to automate tasks like recording patient information, managing legal taxation, and handling administrative processes. My current project is titled "Detecting Arguments in US Tax Court Decisions on Corporate Taxation Cases."
