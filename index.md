## About Me {#about}

I am currently pursuing my Master's degree in Engineering Management at Johns Hopkins University under the supervision of Professor Mahyar Fazlyab. In addition to my studies, I am also working on my startup, Mentat, and serving as an event manager at the Peabody Institute.

My research interests include reinforcement learning, natural language processing, and process automation. I aim to integrate digital and physical systems in human tasks that have yet to be improved or automated. Some of these complex tasks, particularly challenging for computers, involve information recording in the healthcare field, legal taxation, and administrative processes.
