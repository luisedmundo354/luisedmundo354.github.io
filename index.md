## About Me {#about}

I’m a Graduate Research Assistant at the AI Institute at Johns Hopkins University. I earned my M.S. in Engineering Management (ECE/Smart Devices track) from Johns Hopkins in May 2025. My work focuses on retrieval-augmented generation, argument mining, and process automation—linking digital and physical systems to streamline complex workflows in legal, healthcare, and operations.
